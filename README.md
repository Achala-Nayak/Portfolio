# React and Three.js Introductory Project

Welcome to my React and Three.js introductory project! This project is my stepping stone to learning the basics of both React.js and Three.js, while also incorporating other technologies like Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to enhance my skills. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I will be building a dynamic and interactive 3D scene using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. The scene will be integrated into a React application, allowing me to manage the user interface and interactions seamlessly. I'll also utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for adding smooth animations to my components.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React is used to create the overall structure of my application and manage the interactions with the Three.js scene.

- **Three.js**:A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D graphics in the browser.Three.js is used to create and manipulate the 3D scene, add objects, textures, lighting, and more.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps me quickly design and style my components. 

- **Framer Motion**: A library for adding smooth animations and transitions to my React components.
